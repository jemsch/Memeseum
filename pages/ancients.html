                                    <p> Rage comics are crude faces drawn in simple software. These comics started in the primordial cesspool that is 4chan’s /b/ forum. These faces are individually ironic. 
                                        From the simple troll face to the iconic and original “fuuuuuuuuuu” face. 
                                        These memes will always mark a time called 2008 p.c. (pre culture)

                                    <p> Philosoraptor is an old meme and format. 
                                        At this point the societies that made memes had not yet caught onto the remix and photo altering options and resorted to simple text additions.
                                         Philosoraptor was an idea of the profound(ly stupid) epiphany. 
                                         These epiphanies were meant to be mildly amusing and somewhat ironic.

                                    <h3>All your base are belong to us!</h3>
                                    <p>"All Your Base Are Belong to Us" is a popular engrish catchphrase that grew popular across the internet as early as in 1998. 
                                        An awkward translation of "all of your bases are now under our control", the quote originally appeared in the opening dialogue of Zero Wing, a 16-bit shoot'em up game released in 1989.
                                         Marked by poor grammar, the "All Your Base" phrase and the dialogue scene went viral on popular discussion forums in 2000, spawning thousands of image macros and flash animations featuring the slogan both on the web and in real life.

                                    <p>The phrase “One does not simply walk into Mordor” originates from a scene in Peter Jackson’s 2001 film adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings:
                                         The Fellowship of the Ring In the scene, the Council of Elrond reveals that an evil ring must be destroyed by being thrown into the fires of Mount Doom, 
                                         a volcano deep in the territory of Mordor. Boromir promptly points out the difficulty of the task by saying, “One does not simply walk into Mordor."
