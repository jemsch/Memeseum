                                    <p>Sacrifice is a simple comic depicting a cult sacrifice of a virgin. 
                                        To properly implement this meme the observer must be able to see that the inserted sacrifice is annoying and therefore would attract no mates.

                                    <p>An unintentional accident on the part of the artist was overseeing how out of touch their depiction of cool may be. 
                                        This lead to the creation of this work which plays on the cool kid idea by having its subjects pretend to be cool. 
                                        Hence the out of touch drawing becomes and ironic joke.

                                    <p>A wholesome piece in which the subject jokingly asks if they were responsible for an event.
                                         In this example the subject is humming a song that is then hummed by another individual, signaling that said song was also stuck in their head.
                                          Despite the enjoyable nature of the song the subject asks if they were responsible.

                                    <p>A simple question one must ask if they wish to understand what happened to them. In this piece the subject is has encountered a kanine who runs away from him.
                                         He begins to question why the kanine does not wish to be near him by asking if he was a bad guy. Implying subtly that a dog would only run from the terrible or undeserving.

                                    <p>A play on the calm weatherman we can see that the subject of the image is clearly distressed about the situation behind them.
                                         The screen displaying erratic weather and heat waves spells gloom on the area. The weatherman’s distress is visible in his lack of confidence in the survival of the people. 
                                         Causing him to “exclaim we’re all gonna die”.

                                    <p>This meme is one based on irony. The subject of the image is telling the viewer to disperse and that there is nothing important.
                                         This is undercut by the presence of explosions and visible distress in the background.
